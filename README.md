## Overview

Code Quiz is a work-in-progress game developed in pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is a timed quiz that has users answer some basic questions about coding concepts. Users are scored based on how many questions they answered correctly as well as on how quickly they answered them. At the end of the quiz, the user can enter their score into a list of highscores.

Several important bits of functionality around the highscores have yet to be implemented. Highscores are not currently listed in descending order and cannot be cleared. Also, the link to view highscores from the introduction page is not yet active. I plan to fix these issues at a later date, as well as improve the overall look of the app.
